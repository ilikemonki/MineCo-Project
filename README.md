  This Unity project is my starting point to learning Unity. Started from learning tutorials and finally made my own game.
  
This project is to showcase what I can do with the basics of Unity.

The whole project has 66 scripts written for it. The repo will only show half of it.

Uses local and Google Cloud to store save file. Has In-App Purchases and Ads.

All music, art, coding, etc is created by myself.
